**syntax created by how2stats
**This syntax performs a one sample z-test in SPSS
**Simply enter the four relevant values in the line below underneath the 'begin data' command
**The first number is the sample size (35), the second number is the sample mean (105),
**the third number is the population mean (100)
**and the fourth number is the population standard deviation (15)
**Replace the four values below with your own.
**The p value that is reported is based on a two-tailed test.
**To obtain the one-tailed p value, simply divide the two-tailed p value by 2.
**As an extra, this syntax also calcuates Cohen's d as estimate of effect size.
